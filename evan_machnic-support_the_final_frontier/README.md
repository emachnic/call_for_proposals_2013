# Support: The Final Frontier

So many companies are writing some kickass applications these days.
They put months into designing, developing, and scaling the
applications. After the applications are out in the wild, these
companies also come to the realization that they have not thought about
one of the most important parts: support for the applications. This talk
focuses on one a very important but often neglected part of a company
and ways to make sure you can have an awesome Support organization.

## My Name

I have been working with Ruby since 2008 and currently work in
Application Support at Engine Yard. We support some very large customers
and ensure that they're applications meet their customers' demands. When
not working, I love spending time with my wife and kids.
